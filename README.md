# Unified Medical System with Early Outbreak Detection
## Developer: Devadethan R
================================
Problem Statement
-----------------
Abstract
--------

This project proposes a comprehensive unified medical system for India. It integrates data
sharing, appointment booking, medical record access, and a patient support chatbot.
Additionally, the system utilises machine learning to detect potential outbreaks of viral
diseases and pandemics at an early stage by analysing patient symptoms collected from
various regions. This unified approach aims to improve public health outcomes in India by
facilitating efficient healthcare delivery, data-driven disease surveillance, patient
empowerment, and improved patient education through a chatbot interface.

Project Overview
---------------
Unified Medical System that integrates various healthcare functionalities, including patient management, doctor interactions, hospital administration, and an AI-powered assistant called SynthBot.

Routes
------

The application is structured with different blueprints for various user roles:

1. Auth Blueprint
2. Patient Blueprint
3. Doctor Blueprint
4. Hospital Blueprint
5. Admin Blueprint

(Specific route details are not provided in the given code snippets)

Models
------

The project uses MongoDB for data storage. The main models include:

1. User
2. Patient
3. Doctor
4. Hospital
5. MedicalRecord

(Specific model details are not provided in the given code snippets)

SynthBot AI
------------

SynthBot AI is an intelligent assistant integrated into the Unified Medical System. It uses various NLP models to provide advanced functionalities.

NLP Models
-----------

### RoBERTa Question Answering Model

The RoBERTa Question Answering Model uses the Hugging Face API to perform question-answering tasks based on a given context.

### BART Summarization Model

The BART Summarization Model summarizes large texts using the BART CNN Large summarization model from Hugging Face.

### Florence Handwritten Text Recognition Model

The Florence Handwritten Text Recognition Model uses Microsoft's TrOCR base model for handwritten text recognition.

Outbreak Detection System
-------------------------

This system analyzes potential disease outbreaks using NLP and geospatial visualization:

* Uses RoBERTa for question answering about outbreaks
* Extracts location data from context
* Creates interactive maps using Folium
* Geocodes locations using Google Maps API

Key Features
------------

1. User Authentication and Authorization
2. Patient Medical Records Management
3. Doctor Appointment Scheduling
4. Hospital Resource Management
5. Admin Dashboard for System Overview
6. AI-powered Disease Analysis and Outbreak Detection
7. Handwritten Text Recognition for Medical Notes
8. Text Summarization for Medical Reports

Environment Variables
---------------------

The project uses environment variables for sensitive information:

1. HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY: API key for Hugging Face models
2. Google Maps API Key (for geocoding)

Data Sources
-------------

The system uses various text files for context in NLP tasks:

1. disease.txt: Contains information about various diseases, symptoms, and treatments.
2. outbreak_detection_covid.txt: Contains data related to COVID-19 outbreaks and locations.

Deployment
----------

(Deployment details are not provided in the given code snippets)

Future Improvements
-------------------

1. Implement the commented-out image captioning functionality
2. Improve error handling and logging across all modules
3. Integrate more advanced medical AI models for diagnosis assistance

This documentation provides an overview of the SIN13 Unified Medical System based on the available code snippets. For a more detailed documentation, additional information about the database schema, API endpoints, and user interfaces would be needed.
